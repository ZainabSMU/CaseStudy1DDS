# Executive Summary
## About the Project
For this case study, we are given a data set that contains a list of employees, some observations, and a column of attrition (whether they left the company or not). We need to do a data analysis and identify the top three factors that lead to attrition. We are then given another dataset that contains a list of employees, some observations, and no column of attrition. We will build a model using the original dataset to predict attrition in the "No Attrition" dataset.

## Company and Customer Overview
Our company, DDSAnalytics, is an analytics company that specializes in talent management solutions for Fortune 100 companies. To gain a competitive edge over its competition, we have been hired by Frito Lay to identify factors related to employee attrition. Frito Lay aims to predict employee attrition in order to identify those employees who may be more likely to leave the company as well as identifying factors that are related to attrition so that they can best reduce the probability of attrition where desired. 

## Question of Interest
What are the top three factors that contribute to employee attrition?
We will conduct an Exploratory Data Analysis where we cover the following:
- Establish possible factors leading to employee attrition ​
- Explore trends in the data​
- Predict causes leading to employee attrition using Naïve Bayes model​

## Factors Identified
We found the top 3 factors that relate to employee attrition according to our Exploratory Data Analysis
- Job Satisfaction​
- Work life balance​
- Monthly Income
